                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> AI is a powerful technology that carries both benefits and risks. We
                        wish to promote innovation to ensure its potential benefits are responsibly realized and widely
                        shared, while simultaneously ensuring that current and potential societal risks are mitigated.
                        To address the growing societal impact of AI, many jurisdictions are pursuing policymaking. The
                        AI research and policy community lacks consensus on the evidence base relevant for effective
                        policymaking, as has been seen with the debates over California&rsquo;s Safe and Secure
                        Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act (California&rsquo;s SB-1047). Points
                        of contention include disagreement about what risks should be prioritized, if or when they will
                        materialize, and who should be responsible for addressing these risks.</p>
                    <p> In light of
                        this, we firmly believe AI policy should be informed by scientific understanding of AI risks and
                        how to successfully mitigate them. Therefore, if policymakers pursue highly committal policy,
                        the evidence of the associated AI risks <a
                            href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ntia-ai-open-model-report.pdf">should
                            meet a high evidentiary standard</a>. Advancing significant legislation without clear
                        understanding of risks it intends to address may lead to more negative consequences than
                        positive outcomes.</p>
                    <p>We support evidence-based policy and recognize current scientific
                        understanding is quite limited. Therefore, we recommend the following priorities to advance
                        scientific understanding and science- and evidence-based AI policy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to better understand AI risks.</li>
                        <li>We need to increase transparency on AI design and development.</li>
                        <li>We need to develop techniques and tools to actively monitor post-deployment AI harms and
                            risks.</li>
                        <li>We need to develop mitigation and defense mechanisms for identified AI risks.</li>
                        <li>We need to build trust and reduce fragmentation in the AI community.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We describe each of these priorities in more detail below. We believe by following these
                        steps we can pave a more productive path toward robust and responsible AI, anchored in the best
                        scientific practice and AI policymaking that is evidence based.</p>
                    <p><strong>First, we need to better understand AI risks.</strong> As AI models rapidly advance in
                        capability, our level of investment dedicated to research for understanding risks should also
                        increase. However, our understanding of how these models function and their possible negative
                        impacts on society <a
                            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai-interim-report">remains
                            very limited</a>. Because this technology has the potential to be far more powerful than
                        existing technologies and carries wide-reaching implications, it is crucial to have a
                        comprehensive understanding of AI risks. Such a comprehensive understanding of AI risks is the
                        necessary foundation for effective policy. In particular, we recommend extensive and
                        comprehensive study of a broad spectrum of different risks, including discrimination, scams,
                        misinformation, non-consensual intimate imagery, child sexual abuse material, cybersecurity
                        risks, environmental risks, biosecurity risks, and extreme risks. To build understanding, we
                        recommend such studies apply a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07918">marginal risk
                            framework</a>, assessing the additional societal risks posed by AI models compared to
                        existing technologies like internet search engines. This approach will identify AI's unique
                        risks and negative impacts on society. Given our current limited understanding of risks, we
                        recommend policymakers invest resources across academia, civil society, government and industry
                        to foster research on AI risk analysis. Ultimately, these risk analyses will help inform
                        decisions on important policy questions such as whether to release a model, how to release it,
                        and what uses of AI should be permitted.</p>
                    <p><strong>Second, we need to increase transparency.</strong> Analyzing risks and developing policy
                        is challenging <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12941">without adequate information</a>.
                        Transparency requirements for advanced models would facilitate risk analysis of capable models
                        with potentially significant impacts. A number of important questions related to transparency
                        require further study. One key question is the criteria used in policymaking to determine which
                        entities and models are in scope. Current policies such as the US Executive Order on Safe,
                        Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and the European
                        Union&rsquo;s AI Act set thresholds based on <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10799">compute</a> used to train an AI model, but there is
                        currently no <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05694v1">solid evidence</a> behind these
                        numbers. More rigorous studies should be required to establish criteria that strike the right
                        balance between innovation and risk mitigation. Furthermore, we need to <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16268">study</a> the level of information disclosure that
                        best balances usefulness and potential overhead for model developers. Key questions for
                        increasing transparency include: what information should be shared with <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02675">different parties</a> (e.g. the public, trusted
                        third parties, the government); what information developers should report about models including
                        size, a summary of training data and methods, capabilities (such as test results on certain
                        benchmarks and red teaming practices); and incidents such as model theft, unauthorized access,
                        and the inadvertent release of model weights. In line with this approach, the establishment of a
                        <a
                            href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/its-time-to-create-a-national-registry-for-large-ai-models?lang=en">registry</a>
                        for capable models might improve transparency.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Third, we need to develop an early warning detection mechanism. </strong>While current
                        model capabilities may not pose devastating consequences, given the rapid pace of technological
                        development, significantly more powerful and risky AI models are likely to emerge in the near
                        future. It's crucial to draw on research to establish early warning detection mechanisms as soon
                        as possible, providing society with more time to implement stronger mitigation and response
                        measures, and hopefully preventing devastating consequences and the crossing of predefined <a
                            href="https://idais.ai/#">red lines</a>. The mechanisms should encompass both in-lab testing
                        and real-world monitoring. In a lab setting, we need to detect and evaluate the dangerous
                        capabilities of models through rigorous evaluation and red teaming. This involves testing AI
                        models with adversarial scenarios to uncover potential vulnerabilities or unintended behaviors,
                        and assessing how the models could lead to significant marginal risks in areas such as
                        cybersecurity and biochemical weapons. Such evaluation and red teaming analyses can help
                        identify risks before models are deployed in the real world. After the models are launched, the
                        mechanism should enable <a
                            href="https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Recommendation_Improve-Monitoring-of-Emerging-Risks-from-AI-through-Adverse-Event-Reporting.pdf">adverse
                            event reporting</a>, documenting how AI has been used for misuse and what consequences it
                        has caused in the real world. To this end, continuous real-world monitoring of how misuse of AI
                        may have caused harm in each application domain such as biotechnology and cybersecurity is <a
                            href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4634443">crucial</a>. Moreover, we
                        need to determine to whom these early warnings should be reported and design a <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02675">responsible report protocol</a>. This will help
                        ensure that identified risks are communicated effectively among the relevant authorities or
                        stakeholders.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fourth, we need to develop technical mitigation and defense mechanisms.
                        </strong>Investing in research to create these solutions is crucial for effectively addressing a
                        wide range of AI risks. First, instead of just relying on today&rsquo;s alignment approaches, it
                        is important to explore and develop new approaches for building safe AI with the potential for
                        greater safety assurance. This is a complex challenge, which requires a <a
                            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai-interim-report">multifaceted
                            approach</a>. Second, in addition to the long-term research that might be required to
                        develop safer AI models, it is also important to develop <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10295">defensive approaches or immune systems</a> in
                        society to reduce the potential negative impacts from misuse of AI technology. For example,
                        additional defensive systems can involve improving the security posture and defenses of computer
                        systems against security risks caused by AI misuse.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fifth, we need to build trust and unite the community by reducing fragmentation.</strong>
                        Currently, the AI community is heavily <a
                            href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/07/09/reasoning-through-arguments-against-taking-ai-safety-seriously/">fragmented</a>
                        with a variety of views on approaches to risk and policy: the fragmentation poses a challenge to
                        scientific consensus that would support evidence-based AI policymaking. One extreme position
                        calls for strong regulation to mitigate extreme risks, whereas the other extreme calls for no
                        regulation to avoid inhibiting innovation. We support a third approach, an evidence-based
                        approach to AI policy, which reduces fragmentation towards finding the best solutions for
                        fostering innovation while mitigating risks. To achieve this, we recommend the continued
                        development of <a
                            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai-interim-report">collaborative
                            research initiatives</a> that <a href="https://www.ias.edu/stsv-lab/aipolicy">bring together
                            diverse perspectives</a>. Creating platforms for respectful scientific debate and shared
                        problem-solving in a trusted setting can help bridge the gap between different viewpoints.
                        Additionally, establishing interdisciplinary research groups that include AI researchers, social
                        scientists, legal scholars, domain experts, policymakers, and industry representatives can
                        promote a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to AI development, AI safety, and AI policy.
                        We hope this approach can also lead to greater <a
                            href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/governing_ai_for_humanity_final_report_en.pdf">international
                            cooperation</a>.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Call to action.</strong></h2>
                    <p>We call upon the AI research and policy communities to proactively work together to advance
                        science and develop evidence-based policy. </p>
                    <p>We envision that these communities could
                        produce a forward-looking design, or <em>blueprint</em>, for AI policy that maps different
                        conditions that may arise in society (e.g. specific model capabilities, specific demonstrated
                        harms) to candidate policy responses. By working together on this practical, actionable
                        blueprint for the future, we can work towards scientific consensus, even when different
                        stakeholders significantly disagree on how capabilities will evolve or how risks should be
                        addressed. Such a blueprint would complement current guidance on how AI can be developed and
                        deployed responsibly such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management
                        Framework <a
                            href="https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/AI_RMF/Core_And_Profiles/6-sec-profile">use-case
                            profiles</a>. </p>
                    <p>A blueprint for the appropriate conditional response under
                        different societal conditions would organize the discourse on AI policymaking around a concrete
                        artifact. In turn, even if consensus cannot be reached on the likelihood of particular outcomes
                        (e.g. how much can AI increase the likelihood of large-scale cyber attacks or disinformation
                        campaigns), progress could be made towards determining the appropriate course of action.
                    </p>
                    <p>We should organize a series of convenings as a forum for sustained multi-stakeholder dialogue
                        that reflects many different positions, disciplines, and institutions. Through these convenings,
                        we will develop milestones toward progress to science-based AI policy recommendations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Milestone 1: A taxonomy of risk vectors to ensure important risks are well represented</li>
                        <li>Milestone 2: Research on the marginal risk of AI for each risk vector</li>
                        <li>Milestone 3: A taxonomy of policy interventions to ensure attractive solutions are not
                            missed</li>
                        <li>Milestone 4: A blueprint that recommends candidate policy responses to different societal
                            conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By taking these steps, we will build a strong evidentiary foundation, along with broad
                        engagement and thoughtful deliberation, for producing better policy.</p>
